  - Details: 
	    The first innovation lab in Africa, Pulse Lab Kampala brings together
	    data scientists, data engineers, partnership specialists, academics
	    and technical experts to generate high impact data analysis tools to
	    address development challenges. These innovative tools support UN partners
	    and government in anticipating and responding to poverty, impacts of
	    natural disasters, epidemics and food security by leveraging new sources
	    of digital ‘Big Data’ (such as social media, mobile data, online
	    information) and real-time analytics. Through partnerships, and in
	    alliance with the Government, Pulse Lab Kampala acts as an ecosystem
	    catalyst. In addition to keynoting regional conferences on data
	    innovation, the Lab conducts learning sessions for UN partners and
	    workshops for government and academic partners.
